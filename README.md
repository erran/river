# river
A sandbox for me building a React JS app streaming/documenting my way through the journey.

A small river is a *stream*, get it?

## Assumptions
I hope to assume as little as possible besides *most* viewers wanting to build a web application.

The following list is the only assumptions I am aware I am making:

1. You are happy to follow along in English.
    * También estoy feliz de ayudar con preguntas en español.
2. If you are going to write code following this guide you're doing it from a computer.
    * I use Mac OS but a lot of it will transfer to Linux or Windows without too much additional effort.

If I make an assumption that means I lost you somewhere in my code or in a stream please reach out either through a GitHub issue<sup>1</sup> (public for other people) and if you don't feel comfortable asking publicly I am happy to submit the question anonymously as a GitHub issue.

I'll document any assumptions above or in response to the issues. Please search through the [issues page][] for related issues before creating a new ticket, but don't worry as I will link duplicates and clean them up if you don't find one.
